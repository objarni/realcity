Experiment with visualising real data in SimCity inspired heat maps

# Why?

As a citizen of Sweden, and father, I've many times felt the need to understand what services - schools, swimming houses, playgrounds, libraries etc. - to understand where to move, or what to support politically to improve where I'm at. I've used google maps and general googling to understands such things so far, and I think it would be even better seeing clearly using heatmaps and 'toggles' like in SimCity/City Skylines and other simulation games. Why can't we build such a thing?

Example from a game for inspiration:
